# Objective-C ARC Issue: Premature Deallocation of NSString Object

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Objective-C related to Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and memory management. The problem centers around the unexpected deallocation of an NSString object, resulting in crashes or unpredictable behavior. 

## Problem Description
The core issue lies in improper handling of object ownership. A strong reference is expected to ensure an object's lifetime until it's no longer needed. Failure to maintain a strong reference leads to premature deallocation.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing object ownership and ensuring strong references are maintained appropriately throughout the object's lifecycle. In this specific case, a retain cycle is avoided by correctly assigning and releasing references. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the project (Xcode).
3. Observe the application behavior and potential crashes.
